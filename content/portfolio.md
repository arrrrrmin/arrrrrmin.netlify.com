## About me

I'm *arrrrrmin*, a **freelancing data scientist** with interest in NLP projects, python, data pipelines and web development. Since 2018 I work for different customers on various projects as a freelancer. Mostly things boil down to data analysis and machine learning techniques to provide deep learning solutions for my customers problems. In 2018 I also started working on a StartUp idea called [KnowKit](https://www.knowkit.com). As a team of 9 people we work on different NLP topics that mostly target semantic text spaces and natural language understanding (NLU).

# Projects

# Open Source

From time to time I try to help the open source community and support nice projects, used by many of us. Sadly I'm not taking as much time as I'd like to. 

* [`convmoji`](https://pypi.org/project/convmoji/) a simple cli tool to commit Conventional Commits.
* [`moto`](https://github.com/spulec/moto) mocking aws services for testing code, that relys on aws artifacts, without hitting actual endpoints.
* [`albert`](https://github.com/google-research/albert) google-research repo to provide base implementation to pretraining albert transformers.

# Experience

* **Data Scientist**
