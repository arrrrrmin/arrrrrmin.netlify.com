# About me

I'm *arrrrrmin*, a **freelancing data scientist** with interest in NLP projects, python, data pipelines and web development. Since 2018 I work for different customers on various projects as a freelancer. Mostly things boil down to data analysis and machine learning or deep learning to provide solutions for customer needs. From 2018 to 2022 I cofounded [KnowKit](https://www.knowkit.com).

# Projects

# Languages

* English, German, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript
* And a tiny bit of: Go, R and Java

# Open Source

From time to time I try to help the open source community and support nice projects, used by many of us. Sadly I'm not spending as much time as I'd like to. 

* [`moto`](https://github.com/spulec/moto) mocking aws services for testing code, that relys on aws artifacts, without hitting actual endpoints.
* [`albert`](https://github.com/google-research/albert) google-research repo to provide base implementation to pretraining albert transformers.

In addition I currently maintain a very small python package called [`convmoji`](https://github.com/KnowKit/convmoji), which enables conventional commits using emojis on the command line.
