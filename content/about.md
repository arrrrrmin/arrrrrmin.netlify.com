# About me

I'm *arrrrrmin* (Armin Müller-von Fischer), **freelancing data scientist** with interest in NLP projects, python, data pipelines and web development. Since 2018 I work for different customers on various projects as a freelancer. Since 2022 employed in science. 
Researching ml and deep learning techniques in terms of energy efficiency optimization possibilities.

Here I write about stuff I stumble upon. Development, machine learning and little toy project or isolated solutions for very small explicit challenges.
