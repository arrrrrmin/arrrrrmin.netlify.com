**Short Description**/**TL;DR**: Python Developer 🐍 • Freelancer 🚀 • Electronic Music Nerd 🎛️

I'm Armin, a **freelancing data scientist** with special interest in NLP projects. Since 2018 I work for different customers on various projects and technologies as a freelancer. Mostly things boil down to data analytics and machine learning techniques to provide individual services. In 2018 I also started working on a small StartUp idea called KnowKit. As a team of 7 people we work on different NLP topics that mostly target semantic text spaces and natural language understanding (NLU).
