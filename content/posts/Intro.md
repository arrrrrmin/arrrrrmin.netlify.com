**TLDR**: Python Developer 🐍 • Freelancer 🚀 • Electronic Music Nerd 🎛️

I'm Armin, a **freelancing data scientist** with special interest in NLP projects. Since 2018 I work for different customers on various projects as a freelancer. Mostly things boil down to data analytics and machine learning techniques to provide deep learning solutions for the customers problems. In 2018 I also started working on a StartUp idea called KnowKit. As a team of 9 people we work on different NLP topics that mostly target semantic text spaces and natural language understanding (NLU).
