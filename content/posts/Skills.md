Following table is a aggregated overview over technologies, tools and libraries I'm used to work with.

|**Lib/Tool**|**Example**|
|-------------|---------------------------------|
| [`torch`](https://pytorch.org), [`tensorflow`](https://www.tensorflow.org) | Libs that are used to design neural networks, these also provide activation functions, pooling methods and other nice features needed in nn-architectures |
| [`nltk`](https://www.nltk.org), [`gensim`](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) | Natural language processing and topic modeling |
| [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) | Statistics and machine learning, regressions, trees, scoring and validation techniques widly used |
| [`scipy`](https://www.scipy.org), [`numpy`](https://numpy.org), [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org) | Math libraries for computational challenges like data shaping/transformation, statistics or scoring |
| [`flask`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), [`fastapi`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) | Build WebApplications/REST APIs in python |
| [`AWS`](https://aws.amazon.com/) | SageMaker, ECS, ECR, DynamoDB, S3, IOT-Core, IOT-Events, RDS |
| [`d3.js`](https://d3js.org), [`chart.js`](https://www.chartjs.org), [`pyplot`](https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html) | Data visualizations, visual correlations in data |
| [`jupyter`](https://jupyter.org), [`BigQuery`](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) | Data related libs that either wrapp data or transport it as a service |
| [`PostgresQL`](https://www.postgresql.org), [`DynamoDB`](https://aws.amazon.com/de/dynamodb/)| Most commonly I work with PSQL (Postgres) databases and a bit of NoSQL using DynamoDB |
| [`FastAPI`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [`Flask`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/), [`ReactJS`](https://reactjs.org/)| In some projects I also work on RESTful services which are mostly used to provide model predictions or data to certain services or delivered to an frontend. |
| [`Git`](https://git-scm.com), [`Docker`](https://www.docker.com), `...` | All kinds of other features from code versioning, vitualization, ...  |
